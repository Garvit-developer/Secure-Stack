# 🔐 Secure Stack — Secure Offline Password Manager
Hi! My name is **Garvit Dani**, and I created **Secure Stack** to help you store, manage, and protect your passwords with complete offline privacy — making security simple, fast, and fully in your control.

A modern and responsive **Offline Password Manager** built with **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Store passwords locally, organize them by category, check strength, and manage your vault — all with a clean, minimal, and secure interface.

**Password Vault** is a secure, lightweight, and offline-first **Password Manager** built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
All data is stored locally in the browser (`localStorage`) — no servers, no tracking, and complete offline privacy.
